# RPS

This is a cli implementation of Rock Paper Scissor (in Italian 'Morra Cinese').

# How to play

You have to launch the program with your choice, for example:

    ./RPS.py P

Remember:

    * `P` stands for paper
    * `R` accounts for rock
    * `S` is for scissor

## Requirements:

  - docopt
      
        $ pip3 install docopt


## Future plan

Next simple improvements:
Use also "paper" or "Paper" for 'P' and so on..

Future version:

    - version 1: iteractive version - using coroutines
    - version 2: improving game strategy - not a simple random choice
    - version 3: learn from player

experimental version:
Introduce "Spok" and "Lizard"
